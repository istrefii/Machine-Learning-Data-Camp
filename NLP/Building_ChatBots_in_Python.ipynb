        "# Course Description\n",
        "Messaging and voice-controlled devices are the next big platforms, and conversational computing has a big role to play in creating engaging augmented and virtual reality experiences. This course will get you started on the path toward building such applications. There are a number of unique challenges to building these kinds of programs, like how do I turn human language into instructions for machines? In this course, you'll tackle this first with rule-based systems and then with machine learning. Some chat systems are designed to be useful, while others are just good fun. You will build one of each and put everything together to make a helpful, friendly chatbot. Once you complete the course, youâ€™ll also learn how to  connect your chatbot to Facebook Messenger!"

        "\n",
        "It takes in two arguments: seed and temperature. The seed argument is the initial sequence that the network uses to generate the subsequent text, while the temperature argument controls how risky the network is when generating text. At very low temperatures, it just repeats the most common combinations of letters, and at very high temperatures, it generates complete gibberish. In order to ensure fast runtimes, the network in this exercise will only work for a subset of temperature values.\n",
